# Feature Specification: Home Dashboard & Transition Agent Activation

## Overview
Build a Home Dashboard that displays user schedules and an intelligent Transition Agent that provides contextual mindfulness suggestions to help users reset during daily transitions.

## Core Components

### 1. Home Dashboard Screen

#### Primary Display Elements
- **Today's Schedule View**: Calendar integration showing current and upcoming events
- **Current Time Indicator**: Visual highlight of current time block
- **Transition Agent Panel**: Smart suggestion interface below schedule
- **Session History**: Brief completion status of recent activities

#### Data Sources
- Calendar API integration (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook)
- Manual event entry fallback
- User preferences and past engagement data
- Time-of-day patterns

### 2. Transition Agent System

#### Suggestion Logic
The agent analyzes multiple factors to generate contextual prompts:
- Current time and day
- Previous activity type (work, personal, exercise, etc.)
- Next scheduled activity
- Time gap between activities
- User's historical preferences
- Past engagement patterns

#### Suggestion Types & Examples
```
Work → Meeting: "Back-to-back meetings? Try a 1-minute grounding check-in."
Work → Personal: "Transitioning from work to dinner. Want a calming soundscape?"
Free Time: "You have 5 minutes. Try a Box Breathing exercise?"
Morning: "Start your day with intention. Morning gratitude practice?"
Evening: "Winding down? Let's try an evening reflection."
```

#### Fallback Behavior
- No calendar: Default to time-of-day suggestions
- No pattern data: Offer general mindfulness options
- User dismissal: "Remind me later" option with configurable timing

## Technical Requirements

### API Integrations
- **Calendar APIs**: Google Calendar API, Apple EventKit, Microsoft Graph API
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 for calendar access
- **Sync Frequency**: Real-time updates with 15-minute refresh intervals

### Data Models

#### Schedule Event
```typescript
interface ScheduleEvent {
  id: string
  title: string
  startTime: Date
  endTime: Date
  type: 'work' | 'personal' | 'exercise' | 'travel' | 'other'
  location?: string
}
```

#### Transition Suggestion
```typescript
interface TransitionSuggestion {
  id: string
  type: 'breathing' | 'soundscape' | 'meditation' | 'grounding'
  title: string
  description: string
  duration: number // minutes
  context: {
    fromActivity: string
    toActivity: string
    timeAvailable: number
  }
  route: string // navigation path
  config: object // pre-loaded settings
}
```

### Navigation Flow
1. **Home Screen** → Display schedule + agent suggestion
2. **Suggestion Tap** → Route to specific experience screen
3. **Experience Config** → Auto-configure timer, audio, visuals based on suggestion metadata
4. **Session Complete** → Return to Home with completion tracking
5. **Home Update** → Log session, show next suggestion, update schedule view

## User Interface Specifications

### Home Dashboard Layout
```

```

### Interaction States
- **Loading**: Skeleton UI while fetching calendar data
- **Suggestion Active**: Prominent call-to-action button
- **No Suggestion**: Minimal state with manual browse option
- **Post-Session**: Completion feedback and next suggestion preview

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have (MVP)
- [ ] Display synced calendar events from at least one calendar provider
- [ ] Show current time indicator on schedule
- [ ] Generate contextual transition suggestions based on schedule gaps
- [ ] Tappable suggestions that navigate to appropriate experience screens
- [ ] Auto-configure experience settings (timer, audio preset) from suggestion metadata
- [ ] Return user to Home screen after session completion
- [ ] Track completed sessions for analytics and habit reinforcement
- [ ] Handle offline state gracefully with cached schedule data

### Should Have
- [ ] Multiple calendar provider support (Google, Apple, Outlook)
- [ ] Manual event entry for users without calendar integration
- [ ] Suggestion dismissal with "remind later" option
- [ ] Carousel of multiple suggestion options
- [ ] Learning algorithm that improves suggestions over time
- [ ] Weekly/monthly habit tracking visualization

### Could Have
- [ ] Voice activation: "Hey Pause, start my transition"
- [ ] Wearable device integration for biometric-based suggestions
- [ ] AI analysis of calendar event titles for stress level prediction
- [ ] Social features: share completed transitions with friends
- [ ] Custom recurring transition reminders

## Performance Requirements
- Home screen load time: < 2 seconds
- Calendar sync: < 5 seconds initial, < 15 seconds refresh
- Suggestion generation: < 1 second
- Navigation between screens: < 500ms

## Analytics & Tracking
- Suggestion acceptance rate by time of day
- Most effective transition types per user
- Schedule pattern analysis for suggestion improvement
- Session completion rates by suggestion type
- User retention correlation with suggestion engagement

## Error Handling
- Calendar sync failures: Show cached data + retry option
- No internet connection: Offline mode with stored suggestions
- Empty schedule: Default time-based suggestions
- API rate limits: Graceful degradation with longer sync intervals

## Security & Privacy
- Calendar data encrypted at rest and in transit
- Minimal data collection: only necessary for suggestions
- User control over data sharing and deletion
- Comply with GDPR, CCPA privacy requirements

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for suggestion algorithm logic
- Integration tests for calendar API connections
- UI tests for navigation flows
- Performance tests for large calendar datasets
- A/B tests for suggestion effectiveness

## Release Plan
**Phase 1 (MVP)**: Basic schedule display + simple time-based suggestions
**Phase 2**: Calendar integration + contextual suggestions
**Phase 3**: Learning algorithm + advanced personalization
**Phase 4**: Voice integration + wearable device support
