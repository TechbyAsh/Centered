# Pause App - Onboarding & Setup Feature Specification

## Overview
The Onboarding & Setup feature is the user's first experience with Pause, introducing them to the app's core concept of "Pause Moments" and collecting necessary preferences to deliver a personalized experience.

### Data Models

```typescript
// User Preferences Model
interface UserSchedule {
  workStartTime: string; // ISO time format
  workEndTime: string; // ISO time format
  lunchTime: string; // ISO time format
  additionalBreaks: Array<{
    startTime: string;
    endTime: string;
    label?: string;
  }>;
  timezone: string;
}

interface PausePreferences {
  includeBreathing: boolean;
  includeSoundscapes: boolean;
  includeMeditations: boolean;
  includeRituals: boolean;
  favoriteTypes?: string[]; // IDs of favorite activities
}

interface NotificationPreferences {
  enableHaptic: boolean;
  enableSound: boolean;
  enableVisual: boolean;
  frequency: number; // 1-10 scale
  blackoutPeriods: Array<{
    startTime: string;
    endTime: string;
    daysOfWeek: number[]; // 0-6, Sunday-Saturday
  }>;
}

interface OnboardingState {
  completed: boolean;
  currentStep: number;
  schedule: UserSchedule;
  pausePreferences: PausePreferences;
  notificationPreferences: NotificationPreferences;
  permissionsGranted: {
    notifications: boolean;
    calendar?: boolean;
    healthKit?: boolean;
  };
}
```

### Navigation Flow
- Linear progression through screens 1-7
- Option to skip to completion from any screen after the value proposition
- Return to any previous step allowed
- On completion, navigate to home screen with first pause moment suggestion

### Animation Requirements
- Smooth transitions between screens (slide or fade animations)
- Micro-interactions on selection components
- Breathing animation example on Pause Type screen
- Success animation on completion screen
- All animations should maintain the calm, mindful aesthetic

### API Endpoints (if applicable)
- `POST /api/users/preferences` - Save initial user preferences to backend
- `GET /api/recommendations/initial` - Fetch initial pause moment recommendations

## Accessibility Requirements
- Support for VoiceOver/TalkBack
- Sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA compliance)
- Touch targets minimum size of 44Ã—44 points
- Support for larger text sizes
- Alternative text for all images and animations

## Implementation Guidelines

### Styling
- Use the app's color palette:
  - Primary: #3E7B8C (calming blue)
  - Secondary: #F0E6D9 (soft cream)
  - Accent: #F9A875 (warm orange)
  - Background: #F8F5F2 (off-white)
  - Text: #333333 (dark gray)
- Font family: "Avenir Next" or system font with fallbacks
- Rounded corners on all containers (12px radius)
- Subtle shadows for depth (low opacity, soft spread)

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize animations for lower-end devices
- Lazy load assets for faster initial rendering
- Minimize network requests during onboarding
- Cache user preferences immediately after each step

## Testing Criteria

### Unit Tests
- Validation of time inputs
- State management for multi-screen flow
- Persistence of preferences

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end onboarding flow completion
- Permissions handling and fallbacks
- Navigation between screens

### Acceptance Criteria
1. User can complete full onboarding in under 2 minutes
2. All user preferences are correctly saved and applied
3. Notifications are properly configured based on user selection
4. Users understand the concept of "Pause Moments" after onboarding
5. First pause moment suggestion appears immediately after completion
6. Onboarding flow works on both iOS and Android
7. Flow gracefully handles permission denials with explanatory messaging
8. Users who skip portions of onboarding receive reasonable defaults

## Future Enhancements (v2)
- Account creation option
- Cloud sync of preferences
- Personalization based on stress levels or goals
- Integration with calendar for smart scheduling
- Personality-based customization of pause recommendations

## Dependencies
- React Native (with Expo)
- React Navigation for screen transitions
- AsyncStorage for preference persistence
- Expo Permissions API
- Reanimated for advanced animations
- Styled Components for UI
- Expo AV for sound demos

This specification provides a comprehensive blueprint for implementing the Onboarding & Setup feature for the Pause app, with clear guidance on UI components, data structures, and user flow.
